## Payment providers/methods
The PaymentProvider plugin type can be used to provide payment options to the "wateraid_donations" webform handler which are added to the form by the "donations_webform_payment" element.

PaymentProviders are responsible for rendering themselves, processing a payment request, and returning payment transaction details.
