Webform Wizard Extra
--------------------

This module provides additional functionality to Webform.

It hacks the default Webform handler classes and swaps them out with its own provided classes.

It also provides an important option for the current implementation of Webform donation forms to work by adding a third party setting option `one_page` that allows all Webform pages to be rendered at once in the DOM on which the custom BackBone Views are navigating between the steps.

More details can be found in `webform_wizard_extra.webform.inc`.
